# 👋 Hi, I'm Tayyab — SRE | DevOps Engineer | Cloud Architect

I design and build production-grade cloud infrastructure — fast, secure, and automated.

---

### 🚀 Projects I'm Building Now (My GitHub Mission)

- **`terraform-aws-eks-prod`** – Complete AWS EKS setup (✅ Done)
- **`vault-gitops-secure`** – Secure GitOps with ArgoCD, ESO, Vault (🛠️ Building Now)
- **`terraform-azure-aks-prod`** – Azure AKS Infra (🛠️ In Progress)
- **`eks-observability-stack`** – Monitoring, logging, alerting stack on EKS (🗓️ Coming Next)


The final goal is to combine all these projects—and more—into a complete, production-grade system where our app is containerized, deployed automatically with CI/CD best practices, secured with Vault, and fully observable through a robust monitoring and alerting stack.
